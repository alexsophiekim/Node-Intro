### Task 1
Combine both the process and filesystems modules to create a new quiz.  
This quiz needs to (in no particular order)
1. Ask for the users name
2. Ask them a set of questions
3. At the end of the quiz tell them how many questions they got right and wrong
4. Tell them what was the correct answers for the questions they got wrong
5. Output a .txt file with their name as the filename which has all their results on it
6. If someone with the same name does the quiz, we want a different file to be created rather than the other persons file be remove.
